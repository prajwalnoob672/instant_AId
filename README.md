# SportsPro

The SportsPro Technical Support application is designed for the technical support department of a sports software company.The system tracks technical support incidents and manages information about customers,products, and technicians.

# Project Structure
### This project is structured to support containerized full-stack development using:

- Node.js + Express for the backend (API).  

* PostgreSQL for the database.  

+ Docker Compose to run everything together.  

- Nginx to handle HTTPS and to balance requests between servers.  

* A client folder to serve frontend files.  

# Setup and Installation Structure  

+ Clone the repository

      https://github.com/ShristiPoudel/sportspro.git

+ Prepare Environment Variables .env inside the server folder

Example:

         DB_NAME=your_database_name 

         DB_USERNAME=your_db_username 
         
         DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password 
         
         DB_HOST=your_db_host 
         
         DB_PORT=your_db_port 
         
         PORT=your_backend_port

+ Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are Installed If not installed, install Docker Desktop for your OS.

+ Build and run containers

      docker compose up --build  

+ Access the application client:
  
  Open https://localhost:8443 in your browser.  

  API: Accessible under the /api/ prefix,e.g., https://localhost:8443/api/products  

  Postgres DB: Accessible using pgAdmin



+ If you want to run the server outside Docker for development

  i. Navigate into the server - 
          
      cd server   
          
  ii. Install dependencies - 
     
      yarn install or npm install   

          
  iii. Run the server with auto-reload- 
 
      yarn start or npm start  
          

+ if you want to stop running containers

      docker-compose down  
      docker-compose down -v 
      ## to stop and remove all containers,networks and volumes

## Testing the application
API are tested using thunder client.

## Assumptions Made
- Docker and Docker Compose are installed locally.  
* postgreSQl version 14 is used  
+ Self-signed SSL certificates are used for HTTPS (for local testing only).
- Ports (8080, 8443, 5433, 3001-3003) are used.    
* The frontend build is placed in client/ and served by Nginx.  
+ The PostgreSQL database is shared by all backend containers.  
- Three backend servers are identical and stateless for load balancing.  
* Environment variables are managed using .env.  
+ The db_data/ folder persists database data across restarts.
