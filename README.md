# SportsPro

The SportsPro Technical Support application is designed for the technical support department of a sports software company.The system tracks technical support incidents and manages information about customers,products, and technicians.

# Project Structure
### This project is structured to support containerized full-stack development using:

- Node.js + Express for the backend (API).  

* PostgreSQL for the database.

- JWT (JSON Web Tokens) â€“ Used for secure, stateless authentication and authorization  

+ Docker Compose to run everything together.  

- Nginx to handle HTTPS and to balance requests between servers.  

* A client folder to serve frontend files.  

# Setup and Installation Structure  

+ Clone the repository

      https://github.com/ShristiPoudel/sportspro.git

+ Prepare Environment Variables .env inside the server folder

Example:

         DB_NAME=your_database_name 

         DB_USERNAME=your_db_username 
         
         DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password 
         
         DB_HOST=your_db_host 
         
         DB_PORT=your_db_port 
         
         PORT=your_backend_port
         
         JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
         
         JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=your_refresh_jwt_secret
         
         ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRY=15m
         
         REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRY=7d

+ Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are Installed If not installed, install Docker Desktop for your OS.

+ Build and run containers

      docker compose up --build  

+ Access the application client:
  
  Open https://localhost:8443 in your browser.  

  API: Accessible under the /api/ prefix,e.g., https://localhost:8443/api/products  

  Postgres DB: Accessible using pgAdmin



+ If you want to run the server outside Docker for development

  i. Navigate into the server - 
          
      cd server   
          
  ii. Install dependencies - 
     
      yarn install or npm install   

          
  iii. Run the server with auto-reload- 
 
      yarn start or npm start  
          

+ if you want to stop running containers

      docker-compose down  
      docker-compose down -v 
      ## to stop and remove all containers,networks and volumes

## AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM
We use JWT (JSON Web Token) for secure, stateless user authentication. The flow is:

### Register (POST /register)  
   - User sends username, email, password, role.
   - Server saves username, email, hashed password, role and returns success message.

### Login (POST /login)
   - User sends email & password.
   - Server verifies and returns:  
       - accessToken (short-lived JWT)  
       - refreshToken (long-lived)

### Access Protected Routes
   - Client sends:  
       - Authorization: Bearer `<accessToken>`  
       - Server verifies token and allows access.

### Token Expiry & Refresh (POST /refresh-token)  
   - If access token is expired:  
       - Client sends refreshToken  
       - Server validates and issues new accessToken
### Logout (POST /logout)  
   - Client sends refreshToken
   - Server deletes the refresh token

## Testing the application
All APIs have been validated with Thunder Client (VS Code extension).

## Assumptions Made
- Docker and Docker Compose are installed locally.  
* postgreSQl version 14 is used  
+ Self-signed SSL certificates are used for HTTPS (for local testing only).
- Ports (8080, 8443, 5433, 3001-3003) are used.    
* The frontend build is placed in client/ and served by Nginx.  
+ The PostgreSQL database is shared by all backend containers.  
- Three backend servers are identical and stateless for load balancing.  
* Environment variables are managed using .env.  
+ The db_data/ folder persists database data across restarts.
